# Calculator

A simple calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations.
This calculator project is focused on demonstrating unit testing principles and practices. It includes a set of comprehensive unit tests that cover the functionality of the calculator.

## Features

- Addition: Add two numbers together.
- Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
- Division: Divide one number by another.

## Unit Testing
The calculator project includes a suite of unit tests written using a testing framework such as NUnit or MSTest. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness of the calculator's operations.

The unit tests validate the following:

- Addition: Verify that the addition operation produces the correct sum.
- Subtraction: Validate that the subtraction operation yields the expected difference.
- Multiplication: Ensure that the multiplication operation returns the accurate product.
- Division: Check that the division operation gives the correct quotient and handles division by zero appropriately.
- The unit tests are an integral part of this project, aiming to provide confidence in the calculator's functionality and maintain its correctness as the codebase evolves.
